#Describing the Data Set

There are many sites providing  free datasets. Out of all those the dataset which I was very interested is Breast Cancer Detection dataset which is from [Kaggle](kaggle.com). 

Kaggle is one of the popular data science website that provides free public datasets which can be used in the projects in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence domain.We can even share our own datasets.

The dataset which I have choosen is [Breast Cancer Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/merishnasuwal/breast-cancer-prediction-dataset).I have chosen this data set because across the world Breast Cancer is the most common type of cancer in women.With the above data, we can identify the people prone to breast cancer based on their body composition.Using this model, we can detect the breast cancer at early stages and hence the treatment will be easier and also we can spread the awareness. Breast Cancer is mainly detected based upon tumour features such as radius, area, smoothness,texture, perimeter.Specifically, we use these features to differentiate between benign and malignant tumors.Knowing the difference between benign tumors and malignant tumors is very important in the field of medical science and cancer research.In addition, knowing this information may help doctors figure out the best way to manage and treat cancer. 

#Describing a Book

Title: [A Course in Machine Learning](http://ciml.info/dl/v0_99/ciml-v0_99-all.pdf)

Author:Hal Daumé III

The book which I was most interested is A Course in Machine Learning written by Hal Daumé III.This book covers all the introductory areas of Machine Learning. Machine Learning is an important component of growing data science field.It focuses on making decisions without human interfernce based on past data and patterns.Machine Learning being an integral part of data science, has been something that I always want to master.This book definitely helps me get there.There are many aspects such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, decision trees,neural networks etc in this book that aid a beginner's journery to explore Machine Learning.
