There are many sites providing  free datasets. Out of all those the dataset which I was very interested is Breast Cancer Detection dataset which is from [Kaggle](kaggle.com). 

Kaggle is one of the popular data science website that provides free public datasets which can be used in the projects in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence domain.We can even share our own datasets.

The dataset which I have choosen is [Breast Cancer Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/merishnasuwal/breast-cancer-prediction-dataset).I have choosen this data set because across the world Breast Cancer is the most commonn type of cancer in women.
